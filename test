Node js test tasks

1.       Create data base with below 2 tables in ‘MongoDB’ using Node js

2.       Insert records into one of the table.

3.       Select inserted records

4.       Update record

5.       Delete record

 

As discussed we have to build above tasks using node js with help of   Ankit (Please plan your time during next week for above test tasks).

 

 

Please find table structure below. If you want you can use your own table structure.
